# A Very Basic Counter App with React + Vite + Redux 

I know that a [template](https://react-redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started) already exists for React, Redux, Vite and also TypeScript. However, since I do not use TypeScript yet, I want to create my own template. So that I can use it for future projects.


In this small project, I used the React - Vite [template](https://vitejs.dev/guide/). Later on I manually added official Redux toolkit package. 
* `npm install @reduxjs/toolkit`

Hope it helps! Feel free to use it. :blush::sunglasses::rocket:
